# This is a password generator that asks for certain criteria from the user.  The generator functions to give at least 1 of the criteria selected by the user and the fills in the rest of the password length with randomly selected characters from the list of possible characters.

# I only modified the javascript to give it the desired functionality.  HTML and CSS were provided beforehand.
